# Burger

A simple app that uses Handlebars.js and an ORM made from scratch to access a MySQL database of Burgers. Users can add to the list of burgers and indicate whether each burger has been "devoured."

The app runs but does not have the full functionality on the front-end. I still need to make the "Add Burger" button be able to add a new burger to the "Undevoured" list and create a button to allow users to claim they have devoured the burger, moving said burger to the "Devoured" list.
